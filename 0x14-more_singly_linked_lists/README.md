# 0x14. C - More singly linked lists
## Resources
### Read or watch:
- Google
- Youtube
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
- How to use linked lists
- Start to look for the right source of information without too much help
##  Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All  files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- Code uses the Betty style. It has been checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Gglobal variables have been avoided
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
i All your header files should be include guarded
