# 0x15. C - Bit manipulation
-  US Program > Trimester 1 > PP1200 - Intermediate Procedural Programming
-  By Julien Barbier, co-founder & CEO at Holberton School

## Resources
### Read or watch:

- Google
- Youtube
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Look for the right source of information without too much help
- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators
## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Ccode should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
- All header files are guarded
