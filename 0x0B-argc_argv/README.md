# 0x0B. C - argc, argv

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to `explain to anyone`, **without the help of Google**:

- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use \_\_attribute\_\_((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
